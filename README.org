* Introduction

  The AC sources for Cscope.
  Combine the power of AC and Cscope.

  You will see completion from Cscope in "coral3" color.


* Install

  Here is my configurations for AC and auto-complete-cscope for your reference.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; auto complete config with cscope
    (require 'auto-complete)
    (require 'auto-complete-config)
    (require 'auto-complete-cscope)
    (setq default-cscope-mirror-path "/home/jmassonx/.emacs.d/cscope-mirrors/")
    (defun ac-cscope-cc-mode-setup ()
      (setq ac-sources '(ac-source-abbrev ac-source-dictionary ac-source-yasnippet ac-source-cscope)))
    (setq-default ac-sources '(ac-source-abbrev ac-source-dictionary ac-source-words-in-same-mode-buffers))
    (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'ac-emacs-lisp-mode-setup)
    (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'ac-cscope-cc-mode-setup)
    (add-hook 'auto-complete-mode-hook 'ac-common-setup)
    (global-auto-complete-mode t)
  #+END_SRC
  


* Note

  This is expiremental, don't rely on it.
  Completion over tramp is very slow.
