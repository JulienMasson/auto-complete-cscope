* Introduction

  The AC sources for Cscope.
  Combine the power of AC and Cscope.

  You will see completion from Cscope in "coral3" color.

* Install

  Here is my configurations for AC and auto-complete-cscope for your reference.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'auto-complete-cscope)
    (defun ac-cscope-cc-mode-setup ()
      (setq ac-sources (append '(ac-source-cscope) ac-sources)))
    (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'ac-cscope-cc-mode-setup)
  #+END_SRC


* Note

  This is expiremental, don't rely on it.
  Completion over tramp is very slow.
